# Laravel Companies House [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ghazanfarmir/laravel-companies-house.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ghazanfarmir/laravel-companies-house)

This Laravel Package implements an API client for the Companies House REST API. It can be used to look up information about companies registered in the United Kingdom.
As of July 2016, this API is described by Companies House as a "beta service."
More information about this free API can be found
[on the Companies House API website](https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/index.html).

**Please note, this package is still under development and isn't ready for production yet. Once ready, I will remove this warning; so keep looking at this space.**

## Installation

To install, use the following to pull the package via `Composer`.

```
composer require ghazanfar/laravel-companies-house
```

Now register the Service provider in `config/app.php`

```
'providers' => [
    ...
    
    Ghazanfar\CompaniesHouse\CompaniesHouseServiceProvider::class,
],
```
And also add the alias to the same file.

```
'aliases' => [
    ...
    
    'CompaniesHouse' => Ghazanfar\CompaniesHouse\Facades\CompaniesHouse::class,
],
```

## How to use?

#### Company

```
CompaniesHouseApi::company()->search('Company name'); // search companies by name
```

`CompaniesHouseApi::company()->find('company number')` is now going to return an **object** which can be chained to get other resources related data.

For example, calling `get()` on the object will return company information:

```
CompaniesHouseApi::company()->find('company number')->get(); // find companies by number
```

Similarly, you may get information related to other company resources such 'offices', 'company_registered_office', 'filing_history' etc using the helper method `with()` which accepts an array of resources you need.

For example:

```
$obj = CompaniesHouseApi::company()->with('officers')->find('company_number'); // returns an object

$company = $obj->get(); // company information

$officers = $obj->officers(); // company officers collection
```

You may include more than one resources in **with()** using an array.

```
$obj = CompaniesHouseApi::company()->with(['officers', 'registered_office_address'])->find('company_number'); // returns an object
```

$officers = $obj->officers(); // get company's officers collection

$registered_address = $obj->registeredOfficeAddress(); // get company's registered address

#### Officers

```
CompaniesHouseApi::officers()->search('Mir'); // search officers by name
```

```
CompaniesHouseApi::officers()->disqualified()->search('Mir'); // search disqualified officers
```
